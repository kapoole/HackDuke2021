ClassCoin

*Education Track Submission*

## Inspiration
Many students do not understand the concept of how cryptocurrency truly operates. Not unlike when students learned how to write checks, allowing students to learn how crypto works is the next step in preparing our students for the financial world of the future.

## What it does
ClassCoin will provide teachers the opportunity to make a safe, learning-directed environment for students to learn about and experience cryptocurrency. When ClassCoin was minted, half of the coins were set aside for this goal of financial education, while the other half will be made publicly tradable in order to provide price fluctuations for the students to experience. Students will be able to create transactions, build NFTs, and view lessons on how crypto works behind the scenes.

## How we built it
ClassCoin was minted using the ERC-20 standard on the Ropsten Ethereum network. Half of the coins will be set aside for the goal of financial education, and will only be sold for the purposes of building the platform. The other half will be made publicly available for trading on major cryptocurrency platforms. Right now, the platform and cryptocurrency are only in a test mode, since they should be audited before being made publicly available.

## Challenges we ran into
After further research later into the night, we determined that auditing is almost a necessity before deploying a cryptocurrency onto the main network. As such, we began building the platform after determining that this is the case. Right now, the cryptocurrency is accepted as a smart contract on the Ropsten test network, but can be deployed on the mainnet with minimal effort.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We spent most of our time researching and learning how to create an ERC-20 coin, which we are particularly proud of, since it is completely possible to trade and use this coin as a real cryptocurrency.

## What we learned
In the process, we learned how to create a cryptocurrency, and develop website mockups using the Figma platform (with thanks to Miggi from the Figma team's workshop!)

## What's next for ClassCoin: Crypto in the Classroom
Next steps include building out the platform to allow new teacher and student onboarding, auditing the smart contract before deploying to the Ethereum mainnet, and creating a nonprofit to manage the platform.
